## Features

- **Rich column types**: text, number, date, checkbox, select, multi-select, and note (links to vault notes)
- **Inline editing**: click any cell to edit its value directly
- **Column management**: rename, change type, configure options, resize, reorder, and delete columns
- **Wrap content**: per-column toggle to wrap cell content to multiple lines
- **Select & multi-select**: color-coded tags with a dropdown picker
- **Multiple views**: create named views, each with its own sort, filter, and column visibility settings
- **Board layout**: kanban-style board view grouped by a select column, with drag-and-drop between columns
- **Sort & filter**: sort by multiple columns, filter with contains / does not contain / is empty / is not empty operators
- **Auto-save**: all changes are saved back to the CSV file immediately

You need to install it via [BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat):

## Usage

1. Use the command palette (`Ctrl/Cmd + P`) and run **Create new database** to create a `.csvdb` file

The `.csvdb` file is a standard CSV file with column metadata encoded in the header row. It remains human-readable and can be opened with any text editor or spreadsheet application.

## License

The majority of this code was written by Claude Code (Opus), but all code has been thoroughly reviewed and tested by a human. I don't really care about licensing, but Obsidian's "Submission requirements for plugins" requires me to pick one, so: [MIT](LICENSE).
